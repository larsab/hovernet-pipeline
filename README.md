# HoVer-Net: Simultaneous Segmentation and Classification of Nuclei in Multi-Tissue Histology Images

A multiple branch network that performs nuclear instance segmentation and classification within a single network. The network leverages the horizontal and vertical distances of nuclear pixels to their centres of mass to separate clustered cells. A dedicated up-sampling branch is used to classify the nuclear type for each segmented instance. <br />

## Set Up Environment using Docker

Use the following repository to set up environment:

[hover_build](https://github.com/uit-hdl/hover_build)


## Getting Started

Inside docker container

Preparation:
1. Edit `generate.sh` 
2. Run `generate.sh` for creating `config.yml`
3. Consider running  `misc/proc_consep_ann.py` and `misc/proc_pannuke_ann.py` once for dataset label preparation

Overall pipeline consits of running scripts consecutively.
1. (optional) `stain_norm.py` - Normalize dataset
2. `extract_patches.py` - Extract smaller patches for training
3. `train.py` - Train the model
4. `infer.py` - Perform inference
5. `process.py` - Perform post-processing
6. (optional) `compute_stats.py` - Evaluate results
7. (optional) `export_model.py` - Export model as (.pb) and as checkpoint


## Repository Structure

- `misc/info.py` contains predefined variables, specific to dataset.
- `config.py` is the configuration file.
- `src/` contains executable files used to run the model.
- `loader/`contains scripts for data loading and self implemented augmentation functions.
- `metrics/`contains evaluation code. 
- `misc/`contains util and data preparation scripts. 
- `model/` contains scripts that define the architecture of the segmentation models. 
- `opt/` contains scripts that define the model hyperparameters. 
- `postproc/` contains post processing utils. 
- `metrics/counts.py` is the file we used for counting TILs and Cancer cells for patients.
